            <h1>Hello World: The Journey Begins</h1>
        </article>

        <div class="post-content">
            <p>Welcome to my new digital garden. This blog is a space where I intend to cultivate my thoughts, share
                what I’m learning, and connect with others who share similar interests.</p>

            <h2>Why Minimalist?</h2>
            <p>In a world full of noise, I wanted a corner of the internet that felt quiet. A place where the content
                stands out, unburdened by unnecessary distractions. The design you see here—clean typography, ample
                whitespace, and a focus on readability—is intentional.</p>

            <blockquote>
                "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication." — Leonardo da Vinci
            </blockquote>

            <p>I believe that good design should be invisible. It should support the content, not compete with it. By
                stripping away the non-essential, I hope to create a reading experience that is both respectful of your
                time and pleasing to the eye.</p>

            <h2>What to Expect</h2>
            <p>I plan to write about a variety of topics, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Software Development and coding practices</li>
                <li>Design systems and user experience</li>
                <li>Personal productivity and workflow optimization</li>
                <li>Random musings on technology and society</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Thank you for stopping by. I hope you find something here that resonates with you.</p>
